title: "ADR-001 — Claude Code Orchestration"
---

**Status**: Proposed  
**Date**: 2026-05-31  
**Context**: The current workflow requires a human to prompt each step: implement, then manually invoke `/review-code`, read the output, prompt Claude to fix, re-review. The goal is to reduce that to one trigger — "implement spec.md" — and have Claude handle the rest without further prompting.  
**Decision**: Not yet made — this document captures the options.

:::caution[Does NOT cover]
CI automation (GitHub Actions, webhooks), evaluation frameworks, or RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines.

## The problem

Today's flow requires a human at each arrow:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    H1["👤 prompt"] --> I["⚙️ implement"]
    I --> H2["👤 /review-code"]
    H2 --> R["🔍 review"]
    R --> H3["👤 fix these"]
    H3 --> F["🔧 fix"]
    F --> H4["👤 /review-code"]
    H4 --> R

    style H1 fill:#85c1e9,color:#1a252f,stroke:#2471a3
    style H2 fill:#85c1e9,color:#1a252f,stroke:#2471a3

    style F fill:#f0b27a,color:#784212,stroke:#e67e22
```

The goal: one prompt in, Claude drives all the arrows.

## Tool landscape

The tools fall into three layers. You need to understand all three to pick the right combination.

```

:::tip[Key insight]
None of these tools have native Claude Code integration. Every option eventually shells out to `claude -p` or calls the Anthropic API directly. The loop is always yours to wire — the tools just differ in how much wiring they do for you.
:::

---

## Layer 1 — LLM Gateways

Gateways do one thing: give you a **single API key and endpoint** that routes to any model (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, Llama, etc.). They are not orchestrators — they don't drive the loop.

| Tool | Self-host | Cost | Best for |
|------|-----------|------|----------|
| **OpenRouter** | No | 5.5% fee, ~27 free models | Zero-infra access to 300+ models |
| **LiteLLM** | Yes (MIT) | Free; enterprise ~$250/mo | Self-hosted routing, spend tracking |
| **Portkey** | No | Free 10K logs/mo; $49/mo Pro | Production observability, cost tracing |

**OpenRouter** is the simplest: sign up, add credits, point any tool at `openrouter.ai/api/v1` with one key. Useful when you want to swap models (e.g. use Gemini Flash for the cheap review pass, Claude Sonnet for implementation) without managing separate credentials.

**LiteLLM** is OpenRouter but self-hosted — you run the proxy, own the routing config, and get per-model spend caps to prevent runaway loops.

---

## Layer 2 — Orchestrators

### Option A — Claude self-drives (zero tooling)

Tell YOLO-mode Claude to run the full loop in one prompt. Claude uses the built-in `Agent` tool to spawn reviewer subagents.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    H["👤 one prompt"] --> C["Claude YOLO"]
    C -->|"Agent tool"| R["reviewer\nsubagent"]
    R -->|flags| C
    C -->|fixes + re-spawns| R
    R -->|clean| D["✅ done"]

    style H fill:#85c1e9,color:#1a252f,stroke:#2471a3
    style C fill:#52be80,color:#145a32,stroke:#196f3d
    style R fill:#c39bd3,color:#4a235a,stroke:#7d3c98
    style D fill:#52be80,color:#145a32,stroke:#196f3d
```

```
implement everything in spec.md, then run /review-code,
fix all flags, and repeat until /review-code comes back clean
```

**Works today. Zero setup.** Weak point: context window is the loop budget; Claude decides when "clean".

---

### Option B — `/run-spec` skill

A SKILL.md that encodes the loop explicitly. User types one slash command.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    H["👤 /run-spec spec.md"] --> SK["run-spec skill"]
    SK -->|"Agent child"| I["implement"]
    I -->|"Agent child"| R["review"]
    R -->|flags| F["fix"]
    F --> R
    R -->|clean| D["✅ PR"]

    style H fill:#85c1e9,color:#1a252f,stroke:#2471a3
    style SK fill:#52be80,color:#145a32,stroke:#196f3d
    style I fill:#52be80,color:#145a32,stroke:#196f3d
    style R fill:#c39bd3,color:#4a235a,stroke:#7d3c98
    style F fill:#f0b27a,color:#784212,stroke:#e67e22
    style D fill:#52be80,color:#145a32,stroke:#196f3d
```

Write `configs/claude/skills/run-spec/SKILL.md` with explicit step-by-step instructions. The skill defines the exit condition — no ambiguity about when to stop.

**~1 hour to build. Uses skills already built. Best next step.**

---

### Option C — n8n (visual orchestrator)

n8n is a self-hostable workflow automation tool (183K GitHub stars) with first-class AI Agent nodes. The key node for this use case: **Execute Command** — lets you shell out to `claude -p` from within a visual flow.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    TR["trigger\n(webhook / manual)"] --> CC["Execute Command\nclaude -p 'implement'"]
    CC --> RV["AI Agent node\n(review model)"]
    RV --> BR{"flags?"}
    BR -->|yes| FX["Execute Command\nclaude -p 'fix'"]
    FX --> RV
    BR -->|no| D["✅ done"]

    style TR fill:#85c1e9,color:#1a252f,stroke:#2471a3
    style CC fill:#f0b27a,color:#784212,stroke:#e67e22
    style RV fill:#c39bd3,color:#4a235a,stroke:#7d3c98
    style BR fill:#717d7e,color:#fff,stroke:#5d6d7e
    style FX fill:#f0b27a,color:#784212,stroke:#e67e22
    style D fill:#52be80,color:#145a32,stroke:#196f3d
```

Pair with OpenRouter/LiteLLM so all model credentials live in one place — n8n just passes through the unified key.

**Best if you want visual debugging of each loop step. ~2 hours to set up. Self-hostable.**

---

### Option D — Dify

Dify (138K GitHub stars) is a visual platform for building and **deploying** LLM-powered apps. More app-builder than dev-automation tool — but its workflow canvas can model the loop, and the output can be exposed as an API endpoint.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    API["POST /workflow/run\n(spec content)"] --> DF["Dify workflow\ncanvas"]
    DF --> I["implement node\n(Claude Sonnet)"]
    I --> R["review node\n(Claude Haiku / Gemini)"]
    R --> BR{"pass?"}
    BR -->|no| FX["fix node"] --> R
    BR -->|yes| D["return result"]

    style API fill:#85c1e9,color:#1a252f,stroke:#2471a3
    style DF fill:#52be80,color:#145a32,stroke:#196f3d
    style I fill:#52be80,color:#145a32,stroke:#196f3d
    style R fill:#c39bd3,color:#4a235a,stroke:#7d3c98
    style BR fill:#717d7e,color:#fff,stroke:#5d6d7e
    style FX fill:#f0b27a,color:#784212,stroke:#e67e22
    style D fill:#52be80,color:#145a32,stroke:#196f3d
```

Limitation: Dify operates on text — it can call the Anthropic API to generate code, but it cannot run `claude` CLI (i.e. Claude Code with filesystem access). Use this when the loop is pure model-to-model, not when Claude Code needs to actually edit files.

**Best if you want a deployable app with a REST API. Overkill for personal dev workflow.**

---

### Option E — CrewAI

Python library for role-based multi-agent workflows. Lowest boilerplate of the code-first options (~35 lines for a working crew). Uses LiteLLM under the hood, so any model per agent.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    SC["Python script"] --> CR["CrewAI Flow"]
    CR --> IA["Implementer agent\n(Claude Sonnet)"]
    IA -->|"subprocess: claude -p"| FS["filesystem changes"]
    FS --> RA["Reviewer agent\n(Claude Haiku)"]
    RA --> BR{"pass?"}
    BR -->|no| IA
    BR -->|yes| D["✅ done"]

    style SC fill:#85c1e9,color:#1a252f,stroke:#2471a3
    style CR fill:#52be80,color:#145a32,stroke:#196f3d
    style IA fill:#52be80,color:#145a32,stroke:#196f3d
    style FS fill:#717d7e,color:#fff,stroke:#5d6d7e
    style RA fill:#c39bd3,color:#4a235a,stroke:#7d3c98
    style BR fill:#717d7e,color:#fff,stroke:#5d6d7e
    style D fill:#52be80,color:#145a32,stroke:#196f3d
```

Caveat: the open-source version lacks built-in tracing. When the loop runs unattended and fails on turn 4, debugging is painful without the paid AMP (Agent Management Platform) tier.

**Best code-first option if you want explicit loop control in Python with low ceremony.**

---

### Option F — `claude --print` headless pipeline

Claude Code's `-p` flag runs non-interactively. Shell-script the loop yourself — review output becomes fix input.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    SC["shell script"] --> C1["claude -p\n'implement'"]
    C1 --> C2["claude -p\n'review diff'"]
    C2 -->|flags| C3["claude -p\n'fix: {flags}'"]
    C3 --> C2
    C2 -->|clean| D["✅"]

    style SC fill:#85c1e9,color:#1a252f,stroke:#2471a3
    style C1 fill:#52be80,color:#145a32,stroke:#196f3d
    style C2 fill:#c39bd3,color:#4a235a,stroke:#7d3c98
    style C3 fill:#f0b27a,color:#784212,stroke:#e67e22
    style D fill:#52be80,color:#145a32,stroke:#196f3d
```

Each `claude -p` call starts cold — no memory of previous turns. The diff grows with each loop iteration. Works well for overnight unattended runs where you don't need a persistent session.

## Tools to skip

| Tool | Why |
|------|-----|
| **Langflow / Flowise** | Squeezed between n8n (better automation) and Dify (better app-building). No compelling advantage for this use case. |
| **Wordware** | Company pivoted in April 2025 to a consumer product ("Sauna"). Workflow product has uncertain future. |
| **Coze (ByteDance)** | Generous free model access but ByteDance data provenance is a concern; better for chatbots than dev automation. |
| **Microsoft Agent Framework** | Powerful but .NET/Azure-oriented and heavy ceremony for a personal dev loop. |

## Full comparison

| Option | User effort per run | Drives Claude Code CLI | Multi-model | Setup cost | Self-host |
|--------|---------------------|------------------------|-------------|------------|-----------|
| **A — Self-drive** | One prose prompt | Yes (native) | No | None | — |
| **B — /run-spec skill** | `/run-spec spec.md` | Yes (native) | No | ~1 hour | — |
| **C — n8n** | Trigger button / webhook | Via Execute Command node | Via OpenRouter/LiteLLM | ~2–3 hours | Yes |
| **D — Dify** | API call | No (API only, no filesystem) | Yes (built-in) | ~2–3 hours | Yes |
| **E — CrewAI** | `python run_spec.py` | Via subprocess | Via LiteLLM | ~2 hours | Yes (lib) |
| **F — Headless pipeline** | `./run-spec.sh` | Via `claude -p` | Via OpenRouter/LiteLLM | ~2 hours | Yes |

## Recommendation

:::tip[Short answer]
**B now. C or E when you need unattended runs or multi-model routing.**
:::

**Start with B** — a `/run-spec` skill is one SKILL.md file, reuses the review skills already built, stays inside Claude Code's context (so it can actually edit files), and the loop is explicit. An afternoon's work.

**Upgrade to C (n8n) or E (CrewAI)** when you need:

- The loop to run without a terminal session open (overnight jobs)
- A cheaper model for the review pass (use OpenRouter to swap Gemini Flash in without changing the loop logic)
- Visual per-step debugging (n8n) or Python control flow (CrewAI)

**D (Dify)** is only interesting if you want to expose the loop as a REST API that something else calls into — not a personal dev tool.
